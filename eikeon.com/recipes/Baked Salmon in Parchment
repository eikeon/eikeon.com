6 (6-ounce) salmon fillets
salt and pepper to taste
6 (15-square inch) pieces parchment paper
1/4 cup chopped basil leaves
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 lemons, thinly sliced
kitchen twine (or tooth picks)

Place a large baking sheet on bottom rack of oven. Preheat oven to 400â„‰. 

Season salmon with salt and pepper. Cut two half inch slices into flesh of each piece of salmon; roll basil leaves and stuff into slits in salmon. 

Place a salmon fillet in the center of each piece of parchment paper. Drizzle each fillet with 1 teaspoon of the oil, then place lemon slices on top. Gather sides of parchment up over salmon to form a pouch, leaving no openings, and tie tightly with kitchen twine. Place packages directly on hot baking sheet in oven and cook for 20 minutes. Transfer to plates and carefully open packages to release steam before serving.
