I am surprised at how delicious this recipe turns out and it could not be simpler to make. The cooked chicken from the Chicken Stock recipe works great in this recipe and so I often make the two recipes together.

1 pound cooked chicken, diced
3 celery stalks, diced
2 scallions, minced (use both white and green parts)
3 tablespoons parsley, minced
4 tablespoons Homemade Mayonnaise
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper

In a large bowl combine all ingredients.
