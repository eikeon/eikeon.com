§ Beet and Ginger Soup with Cucumber

...

1 1/2 pounds small beets, trimmed and scrubbed
3 tablespoons olive oil
coarse sea salt
1 small leek, white and light green parts only, chopped
1 clove garlic, smashed
3 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger, or more to taste
3 cups chicken broth
3 cups water
juice of 1 lemon, or to taste
1/2 english cucumber, peeled, halved lengthwise, seeded, and chopped into 1/8 inch cubes crème fraîche, for serving

Heat the oven to 325 ℉. Place the beets in a bowl, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon oil, and season with salt. Toss to coat. Place the beets on half of a large sheet of aluminum foil and fold it over to make a pouch. Seal tightly. Put on a baking sheet, place in the oven, and roast until a fork easily pierces the beets, about 1 1/4 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool.
Peel off the skin and cut the beets in quarters.
Warm the remaining tablespoons olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the leek and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes more. Season lightly with salt. Add the beets, chicken broth, and water, bring to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes.
Transfer the soup, in batchs, to a food processor and process until smooth. Return the soup to the pot. Add lemon juice to taste. Then adjust the seasoning, adding more salt, lemon juice, and ginger if you wish.
Just before serving, add the cucumber and stir. Then ladle into bowls and serve. You can serve this with a dollop of Crème fraîche. The soup should not be too hot; it could even be served chilled or at room temperature.

§ Chicken Stock

This is a simple recipe for making chicken stock. Our favorite use of the chicken stock is to use it in place of water when cooking rice, usually Lundberg Jubilee, Gourmet Blend of Whole Grain Brown Rice or Lundberg California Sushi Rice. We often use the cooked chicken from this recipe to make the Curried Chicken Salad recipe.

4 pounds chicken
7 cups water
1 large onion, halved
3 stalks celery
3 carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
salt to taste

Place the chicken in a large pot over high heat. Add water to cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 1 hour.
Remove chicken from pot. Leave water in pot. Cool chicken. Remove skin and bones from meat. Return bones and skin to pot. Add onions, carrots, celery, bay leaf, ginger, and salt. Continue simmering for 3 to 4 hours.
Strain and cool the stock, uncovered.
Use the meat for soups, salads, sandwiches, or other dishes where cooked chicken is needed. After stock has been defatted, use or freeze immediately. I freeze the stock in one cup amounts and use instead of water for cooking rice or vegetables or making gravy.

§ Creamy Curried Sweet Potato Soup

...

1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup onion, coarsely chopped
1 large clove garlic, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, coarsely grated
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon tumeric
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick
6 cups chicken broth, or as needed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
6 to 8 teaspoons fresh cheese

Heat the oil in a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients. Add the onion and sauté over medium heat until it begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the ginger, cumin, coriander, cardamom, turmeric, and red pepper flakes, if using, and stir well. Add the sweet potatoes and broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the sweet potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes.
Puree the soup in batches in a blender or food processor. Season to taste with salt and pepper. The soup can be made ahead of time and refrigerated. Reheat slowly to serve. If the soup is too think, add a little more stock.
Ladle into mugs, top each serving with a teaspoon of cheese, and stir to melt a little.

§ Crispy Sesame Carrots

A colorful tasty side dish or snack. A mandoline works well for slicing the carrots into uniformly thin rounds.

2 pounds carrots, sliced into thin rounds
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
coarse sea salt
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
2 tablespoons toasted black sesame seeds

Preheat oven to 350 ℉
In large sauté pan over medium heat, sauté sliced carrots in olive oil until just soft, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat, toss with toasted sesame oil and sea salt to taste, spread out on cookie sheet and bake 30 minutes. Check frequently and move carrots around to prevent burning. Remove from oven, toss with sesame seeds and serve.

§ Curried Chicken Salad

I am surprised at how delicious this recipe turns out and it could not be simpler to make. The cooked chicken from the Chicken Stock recipe works great in this recipe and so I often make the two recipes together.

1 pound cooked chicken, diced
3 celery stalks, diced
2 scallions, minced
3 tablespoons parsley, minced
4 tablespoons Homemade Mayonnaise
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
freshly ground black pepper

In a large bowl combine all ingredients.

§ Curried Zucchini Soup

My favorite soup to date. One of the recipes from "The Essential New York Cookbook" that we have made and enjoyed. The soup is best made in the summer with in-season baby zucchinis.

6 small zucchini, chopped
1 large onion, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon fresh ginger root, grated
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
3 cups chicken broth
3 tablespoons raw rice
1 1/2 cups whole milk
sea salt
black pepper, freshly ground
chives, minced

Combine the zucchini, onion, ginger, curry powder, and mustard in a saucepan, add the chicken broth and rice, and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for about 45 minutes.
Puree the mixture with an immersion blender. Add the milk and season with salt and pepper. Chill thoroughly or serve hot. Garnish with chives.

§ French Chicken in a Pot

This chicken dish is wonderfully aromatic from the moment the sautéing begins and results in a sauce that is equally wonderful. The left over sauce works great as an ingredient in other recipes. Oh, and the chicken is tasty too.

1 whole roasting chicken
2 teaspoons gray sea salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
3 fennel stalks, chopped
6 garlic cloves, peeled and trimmed
1 bay leaf
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Adjust an oven rack to lowest position. Preheat oven to 250 ℉.
Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.
In a 6 3/4 quart Dutch oven over medium, heat the oil until just smoking. Add the chicken, breast-side down. Scatter the onion, fennel stalk, garlic, bay leaf, and rosemary around chicken.
Cook until the breast is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken breast-side up and cook until chicken and vegetables are well browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
Remove the Dutch oven from the heat. Place a large sheet of foil over the pot, then cover tightly with the lid.
Transfer the pot to the oven and cook until a thermometer registers 160 ℉ when inserted in thickest part of breast. A 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 pound chicken will take about an hour to cook, and a 5 to 6 pound bird will take close to 2 hours.
Transfer the chicken to carving board, tent with foil and let rest for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, strain chicken juices from the pot through fine-mesh strainer into a fat separator, pressing on solids to extract liquid. Discard the solids. You should have about 3/4 cup of juices.
Allow the liquid to settle 5 minutes, then pour into a saucepan and set over low heat.
Carve the chicken, adding any accumulated juices to the saucepan. Stir lemon juice into the saucepan to create the jus, or sauce. Serve the chicken, passing jus at table.

§ French Lentils with Roasted Root, Caramelized Onions and Thyme

Lentils are a perfect compliment to winters colorful and sweet roots and squashes. Not only are there great source of protein, but their somewhat earthy and savory taste enhances a variety of winter meals.

While vegetables are roasting, rinse lentils and place in pot with vegetable stock and a pinch of salt. Bring to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until just tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and drain well. Toss with 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon lemon juice and set aside. 
In large skillet over medium heat, sauté onion in remaining tablespoon olive oil until it starts to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add mushrooms and mirin and continue sautéing. Add remaining 3 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon at a time to deglaze pan and caramelized vegetables. Add thyme and sauté 2 minutes longer, for a total sauté time of 12 to 14 minutes.

Quick, easy, and delicious.

2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon tomato paste

Taste and add salt if necessary.
Using an immersion or regular blender or a food processor, puree half the soup, then return it to the pot; don't over-puree it, the soup should be somewhat chunky. Reheat the soup if necessary, then stir in the lemon juice and cilantro. Serve drizzled with olive oil and dusted lightly with chile powder if desired.

§ Seaweed and Cabbage Sauté

We have yet to try this recipe. The description from the Clean Food book is as follows: I crave this powerhouse combination in the spring for its incredible cleansing and healing properties. Sea vegetables are loaded with easily absorbable calcium. Cabbage is a tonic for the stomach and digestive system, a blood alkalinizer, and a rich source of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. Now that's strong medicine! This recipe doubles easily and keeps 4 to 5 days.

1 cup dried arame
1 teaspoon grapeseed oil
1 red onion, cut into matchsticks
3 carrots, cut into matchsticks
1/2 small cabbage, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons tamari
2-3 dashes ume plum vinegar
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil

Soak arame in 4 cups of water for 15 minutes, drain well and set aside.
In large skillet over medium head, sauté onion in grapeseed oil until translucent, 3 minutes. Add carrots and sauté another 2-3 minutes. Add cabbage and tamari and sauté until all vegetables have softened. Add seaweed and cook to heat through. Remove from heat, add vinegar and toasted sesame oil and serve warm or chilled.

2 teaspoons raw honey
1 pinch sea salt

In a bowl whisk together toasted sesame oil, brown rice oil, ginger root, and honey into a dressing.

§ Vegetable Stock

This is a basic vegetable stock recipe that is a tasty and healty addition to many recipes. The recipe is from Deborah Madison's book Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone. The book has a great section on vegetable stocks which I will be consulting as I look to incorporate more ingredients.

1 large onion
2 large carrots
2 fennel stocks, including a few leaves
1 bunch scallions, including half of the greens
leek trimmings: roots and leaves
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
8 parsley branches
6 thyme sprigs or 1/2 teaspoon dried
2 bay leaves
sea salt

Scrub the vegetables and chop them roughly into 1 inch chunks. Heat the oil in a soup pot. Add the vegetables, garlic, and herbs and cook over high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently. The more color they get, the richer the flavor of the stock. Add 2 teaspoons salt and 2 quarts cold water and bring to boil. Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Strain.
