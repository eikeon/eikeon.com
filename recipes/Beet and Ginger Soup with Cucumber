...

1 1/2 pounds small beets, trimmed and scrubbed
3 tablespoons olive oil
coarse sea salt
1 small leek, white and light green parts only, chopped
1 clove garlic, smashed
3 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger, or more to taste
3 cups chicken broth
3 cups water
juice of 1 lemon, or to taste
1/2 (seedless) english cucumber, peeled, halved lengthwise, seeded, and chopped into 1/8-inch cubes
crème fraîche, for serving (optional)

Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Place the beets in a bowl, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon oil, and season with salt. Toss to coat. Place the beets on half of a large sheet of aluminum foil and fold it over to make a pouch. Seal tightly tightly. Put on a baking sheet, place in the oven, and roast until a fork easily pierces the beets, about 1 1/4 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool. 

Peel off the skin and cut the beets in quarters. 

Warm the remaining tablespoons olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the leek and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes more. Season lightly with salt. Add the beets, chicken broth, and water, bring to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes.

Transfer the soup, in batchs, to a food processor and process until smooth. Return the soup to the pot. Add lemon juice to taste. Then adjust the seasoning, adding more salt, lemon juice, and ginger if you wish. 

Just before serving (the soup should not be too hot; it could even be served chilled or at room temperature), add the cucumber and stir. Then ladle into bowls and serve. You can serve this with a dollop of Crème fraîche.


Serves 4.
