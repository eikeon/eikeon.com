Quick, easy, and delicious.

3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 to 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
large pinch of cayenne pepper, or more to taste
4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
2 cups water
1 cup red lentils, picked over and rinsed
1 large carrot, peeled and diced
juice of 1/2 lemon, or more to taste
3 tablespoons cilantro, chopped

Heat the oil in a large pot over high heat until hot and shimmering. Add the onion and garlic and sauté until golden, about 4 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, cumin, salt, black pepper, and chile powder and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the broth, water, lentils, and carrot and bring to a simmer, then partially cover the pot and turn the heat to medium-low. Simmer until the lentils are soft, about 30 minutes. Taste and add salt if necessary.

Using an immersion or regular blender or a food processor, puree half the soup, then return it to the pot; don't over-puree it, the soup should be somewhat chunky. Reheat the soup if necessary, then stir in the lemon juice and cilantro. Serve drizzled with olive oil and dusted lightly with chile powder if desired.
