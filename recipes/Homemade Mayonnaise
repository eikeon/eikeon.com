...

1 whole egg + 1 egg white
1 teaspoon prepared Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
generous pinch of sea salt
3/4 cup olive oil

Puree all ingredients in the food processor, except olive oil. Slowly add olive oil in small amounts while the food processor is on -- be patient this takes time. Add more sea salt if desired. You could also add fresh herbs like parsley, or chives to make an herbed mayonnaise.
