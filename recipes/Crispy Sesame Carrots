Have yet to try this recipe, but it's now on deck. Will update description once we have made it.

2 pounds carrots, sliced into thin rounds
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
Coarse sea salt
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
2 tablespoons toasted black sesame seeds

Preheat oven to 350℉

In large sauté pan over medium heat, sauté sliced carrots in olive oil until just soft (about 6 minutes). Remove from heat, toss with toasted sesame oil and sea salt to taste, spread out on cookie sheet and bake 30 minutes. Check frequently and move carrots around to prevent burning. Remove from oven, toss with sesame seeds and serve.


Serves: 4
