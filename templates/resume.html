  <h3 class="title">Senior Software Engineer <span class="organization"><a href="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>, Repository Development Group</span> <span class="timeperiod"><time datetime="2007">2007</time> - present</span></h3>

  <p>
    Sorted many billions of tweets in the historic Twitter Archive while leading the adoption of emerging technologies by demonstrating their effective use. This involved an emerging algorithm, language, and computing paradigm; in particular, implemented a cache-oblivious sorting algorithm, <a href="https://github.com/eikeon/funnelsort">funnelsort</a>, in <a href="http://golang.org/" title="golang">Go</a> and utilized cloud computing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Communicated and applied expertise in web technologies, Python, and RDF by collaborating with colleagues on repository software design and development. Led technical direction on Chronicling America, a Website providing access to historic newspaper pages, and made key contributions to the World Digital Library project.
  </p>

  <p>
    Advocated for principles and processes that made the group stronger. Strengthened and improved the group's vision and relationships.

  <p>
    Utilized <a href="https://github.com/eikeon/redfoot">Redfoot</a> to build a
    prototype for the <a href="http://www.policyawareweb.org/">Policy
      Aware Web</a> project and to
    build Profiles in Terror, a website built in order to explore how the Semantic
    Web can be used to analyze terrorist activity. Worked
    on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm">cwm</a>
    / <a href="http://www.mindswap.org/~katz/pychinko/">pychinko</a>

  <p>
    Maintained an active community around RDFLib.
    Participated 
    in <a
	  href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/">SWAD-Europe
      Workshop on Semantic Web Storage and Retrieval</a> to share
    lessons learned with other data storage implementors as well as other workshops and conferences.

  <h3 class="title">Semantic Web Technologist <span class="organization">Eikco, LLC</span> <span class="timeperiod"><time datetime="2001">2001</time> - <time datetime="2003">2003</time></span></h3>
  
  <p>
    Created and developed <a href="https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib">RDFLib</a>, the
    leading Python RDF library, and created a community around
    it. <!--Implemented an RDF/XML parser that is fully conformant to
	    latest working drafts and provided implementor feedback on the
	    drafts. Defined a TripleStore interface and extended it to define
	    an InformationStore interface, a TripleStore interface that
	    includes support for contexts. Implemented several different
	    TripleStores and InformationStores with various backends. -->
    Participated in the Semantic Web community by providing early
    implementor feedback on W3C specifications and building proof of
    concepts.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As principal architect,
    developed <a href="https://github.com/eikeon/redfoot">Redfoot</a>, an
    application for collaborative information management. Defined a
    notion of hypercode; a marriage of code, metadata about the code,
    and the web. Redfoot and its applications are built upon this
    notion of hypercode.

    product. Augmented the schema support by allowing for XDR and XSD
    schemas in addition to Bowstreet's proprietary schema format.
  </p>

  <p>
    Assisted company on advanced technology-related issues by tracking
    standards and technologies, communicating expertise, and providing
